# Base64-Python

A little code sample for converting images to base64 strings and back again in Python3.
Good if you need to transport files via JSON.
Use as you'd like.

Written using Python 3.9.2 64-bit. I think the minimum version is Python 3.6 due to f-strings. Not tested with Python 2.7, if you are using Python 2.7 get the hell of it and on to Python3.

Tested on a Raspberry Pi.
